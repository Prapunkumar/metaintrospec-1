You could be from different semesters. Either 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th year, etc.</br>



Our Purpose is to make you more capable than spoon-feeding.</br>



We designed the first version of Metaintrospec to help you understand yourself with simple five questions per day for five days.</br>



Once you log in you get to fill the first set of questions on day one.</br>



The second set will be released on the following day, like this it will be for the next four days.</br>



Parents can also join to see the outcome of their childâ€™s performance.</br>
